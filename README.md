# IMPORTANT!
The Floata-Buddy is not a cartified life-saving device. We are not resposible for any harm caused from malfuncioning parts as this is just a prototype and needs a lot of work. We want to make an impact on the world and to do that we need your help :)

# Floata-Buddy
The Floata-Buddy MKII is a inflatable floatation device that is mounted on your belt.
We want to be clear that this is just a prototype and should never be trusted to save someone with how it is currently. 
Our team hopes to get as much input from the community on how to make it better for everyone who might have a Floata-Buddy in the future. All instructions for assembly and creation are included in this repository.


# About Our Team
We are a team of 7 students on the FLL Robotics Team Mechanical Mayhem. As a part of our robotics carrer, we were tasked with designing something that could help solve a problem that people who explore the ocean might face.
